# OBS-shaderfilters
These are shader filters for OBS Studio 22+

## Synopsis
These filters are applied to your stream and can greatly enhance what is possible when streaming.
For instance, I use it to make live matrix effects on my stream by loading another video behind the luminance filtered stream video (game)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
